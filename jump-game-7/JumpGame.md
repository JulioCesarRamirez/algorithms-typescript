## 1871. Jump Game VII

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to `'0'`. You can move from index `i` to index `j` if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- `i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)`, and
- `s[j] == '0'`.

Return `true` if you can reach index `s.length - 1` in `s`, or `false` otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: `s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3`
Output: `true`
Explanation:
`In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3.` 
`In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.`

Example 2:

Input: `s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3`
Output: `false`
 
**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i] is either '0' or '1'.`
- `s[0] == '0'`
- `1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length`

## Explanation:

**1. Initialization:**

- `n` is the length of the binary string `s`.
- `queue` is initialized with the starting index `0`.
- `maxReach` keeps track of the farthest position we've processed to avoid redundant checks.

**2. BFS Loop:**

- Dequeue an element from queue, representing the current position `i`.
- For each position j in the range [i + minJump, min(i + maxJump, n - 1)]:
    - Ensure that j is greater than maxReach to avoid re-processing positions.
    - If `s[j]` is `'0'`, check if it's the last position `(n - 1)`. If it is, return `true`.
    - Otherwise, add `j` to the queue for further processing.

- Update `maxReach` to the furthest position checked in the current iteration.

**3. Return:**

- If the loop completes without reaching the last position, return `false`.

This approach ensures an efficient traversal of the string s while checking valid jumps within the given constraints. The use of the queue and `maxReach` helps manage the state and avoid unnecessary checks.
